# Udacity-Deep-Learning-Nanodegree

Projects completed for Udacity Nanodegree program on Deep Learning  

## Project 1: Predicting Bike Sharing Patterns
- Goal to predict bike sharing activity based on various other features like weather etc.;
- Manual implementation of fully connected neural network;
- Parameter tuning to find best network depth, width and training rate.

## Project 2: Classifying Dog Breeds
- Goal to predict dog breeds using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based on RGB images;
- Pytorch implementation of CNN classifier;
- Network tuning for best network configuration, including depth, dropout layer, batch normalization, optimizer and training rate.

## Project 3: Generating TV Scripts
- Goal to generate new Seinfeld scripts using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)s based previous scripts;
- Pytorch implementation of LSTM network;
- Network tuning for learning rate, embedding dimension, hidden dimension and number of layers.

## Project 4: Face Generation
- Goal to generate new faces using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) using celebrity face dataset;
- Pytorch implementation of GAN network;
- Experimented with different loss functions and analysed training loss over time.

## Other Notebooks
- Implementation of Cycle Gan for unpaired style transfer of landscape images, which adds the cycle-loss on top of adversarial loss.
